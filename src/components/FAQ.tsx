      question: "How realistic are the AI interview simulations?",
      answer: "Our AI interviews are designed to closely mimic real interview experiences. The system uses advanced natural language processing to understand your responses and provide relevant follow-up questions, just like a human interviewer would. Many users report that the questions they encounter in our simulations are very similar to those they face in actual interviews."
    },
    {
      question: "What types of interviews can I practice?",
      answer: "InterviewAI supports multiple interview formats including behavioral interviews, technical interviews for various roles (software engineering, data science, etc.), case interviews for consulting positions, and industry-specific interviews for fields like healthcare, finance, marketing, and more."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the feedback system work?",
      answer: "After each practice interview, our AI analyzes your responses based on factors like content relevance, structure, clarity, and confidence. You'll receive detailed feedback on what you did well and specific areas for improvement. The system also provides suggestion alternatives for stronger responses."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I practice for specific companies?",
      answer: "Yes! With our Professional and Premium plans, you can select specific companies to tailor your practice sessions. Our system will include questions commonly asked by those companies and adjust the interview style to match their known interview processes."
    },
    {
      question: "Is my data secure and private?",
      answer: "Absolutely. We take data privacy very seriously. All your interview sessions and personal information are encrypted and securely stored. We do not share your data with third parties, and you can request deletion of your data at any time through your account settings."
    },
